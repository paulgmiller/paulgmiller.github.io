## Notes
Trying to Enter in Flying bike competition. 
Ideally i'd ferment at low 60's and then drop to mind 40's for faux lagering. Not sure best way to achieve the first one. Garage is too cold. House is too warm. Fridge at 60 is silly.

So it happily bubbled away in my 55 degree fridge for 3 days then the temp dropped and bubbling stopped. I moved it to basement bathroom where it was 60-65 for the rest of the week. It never recovered bubbling but gravity reading 1 week in seems like it fermented down goign to give it few extra days on primary and even longer on secondary. ![gravity reading](https://images.weserv.nl/?w=900&url=https://pe7tla.dm.files.1drv.com/y4mv9a97yaYaZCo-xp1Qe6GyB6ZVX2ym6Lncr44tNMnmiH5CAQG4zD3RrdeWhdKjHHj-ZF4diGSy3Bxz9Gpk2udm9dOl9tI1ShHRl7WdjxKhkSi60z_awEKv9BbM8Nk-OPYvDEAFaeY0GwqjLrO5wsOO6A8upg3xO9kRQH2dsoPMpA7LKfr5fXojOGS-q6ZPXLI2YSynRB8sdHrQx-u-juuDQ?width=3024&height=4032&cropmode=none)
