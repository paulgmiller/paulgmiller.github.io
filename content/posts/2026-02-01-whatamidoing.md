## Tuesday
Kids denitist and drop off.
Kids Bus and Othodonteist

Clerks - 6 hours!
First two hours codex completely failed.
Tried manually in afternoon and realized I needed frontend code and Clerks had no way to get a session cookie on dev ( :( ). Also clerks jwts might just be too short and I might need to make my own?
So really a design issue that codex/claude would happily just throw more shit at the wall with none of it sticking

Kids pickup dinner (Mussels!) dominoes. House cleaning

Is Clerks the right choice? Shoudl I manage my own session rather than use javascript on every page?
