A friend asked what do we do at lake cresent so I wrong this down

1. Hurrican ridge is an amazgin drive even if you don't do the walk/hike to the top (paved hiking path)
2. Sol duc springs I have never done but seems popular
3. port angeles has a few nice resteraunts. Lots were closed for pandemic when we were there but [this one was nice](https://goo.gl/maps/1Lx78nvs5AWH5S2N7)
4. there was mediocre wine tasting between there lake cresetn and port angeles
5. if you have way too much time goto victoria on the ferry
6. [this place was pretty cool if you like tidal ecosystems. And there was surfers](https://goo.gl/maps/aJxhB7zMPMszLnWj8)
7. [there is a nice bike path to devils punchbowl](https://goo.gl/maps/w1U3L3KNxHgG5vSS8)
8. this [falls hike](https://goo.gl/maps/jc6WnsAVRHQC3gFN9) is a pretty trivial hike I did with the boys while wintana was working on vacation 
9. this year I am going to try and have benji do [stormking](https://goo.gl/maps/mEbgnuuLRzSpCcD5A) and maybe drag nate along.
10.  But lastly I would be remis to mention the [olympic game farm](https://goo.gl/maps/BdiAZrZcEpvWHfaL8) in sequim. It is so ridiculous brad, kristen, wintana an I literally spent 30 minutes laughing about it at camping

 But also I am bringing Kubb and Bocci and wine to our cabin where there are canoe and other rentals so just doing nothing is also an option.
