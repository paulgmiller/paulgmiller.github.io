Balloon Buns

## Indgredients
* 1 pkg.  active dry yeast
* ¼ cup warm water (105 degrees)
* ¾ cup lukewarm milk
* ¼ cup sugar
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 egg
* ¼ cup butter or margarine
* 3½ -3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
* 18 large marshmallows
* 1 Tbsp. cinnamon
* 1 cup sugar 
* ½ cup butter, melted

## Directions

In mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add milk, ¼ cup sugar, the salt, egg, butter and half the flour; mix with spoon until smooth.  Add enough remaining flour to handle easily; mix with hand.  Turn onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Round up in greased bowl; bring greased side up.  Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 2 hours. (The dough will retain a finger impression when touched.)
Punch down; divide dough in half.  Divide the first half into nine equal pieces.  Form each piece into a 3½ flatten circle about ¼ inch thick.  Mix cinnamon and sugar.  Dip each marshmallow in melted butter and then in cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Wrap a dough circle around the coated marshmallow, pinching tightly at the bottom to seal.  Dip roll in butter and then in cinnamon -sugar mixture.  Place in greased medium muffin tin, pinched side down.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Let rise 30 minutes.  
Heat oven to 375.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes.  Cover with foil for last 10 minutes if baking.  Hint: Place a sheet of foil under muffin tin to catch any melted marshmallow that escapes.

## Short cut
Frozen bun dough can also be used.  Allow to thaw but not rise.  Flatten and prepare as above.  Let rise at least 30 minutes depending on how cold dough was.  Bake as above.
