Trying to make a kickstarter for this laughable project but some numbers. 

 max take off weitght=439985kg
Crusing speed = 920 km/h 

27359 km/h Orbital velocity
20kg payload.

(439985*920- 27359*20)/439965  = 918.79
you'd only lose like 2km/h on the plane

Air pressure is 14% of sealevel at 747 cruising altitude

From brad:
Looks like 70000kg of capacitors will get you 10.4M Wh of energy storage
I'm getting 563M Joules to accelerate 20kg to orbital velocity  = 156K watt hours
And we have 10.4M Wh to work with

76.25meters of runway if you go tail ot nosecone. 


### Bonus section 
I also wanted to use a rockoon to try and win the n-prize

Weather balloon

30ft/1200g 
7.6lb  nominal lift, 15 lbss max lift. 
115,0000 (35,000 m) burst 

6400

Cost 124:

Let's assume that 

At 110,000 above sealevel. 

Propellant needed to get 10 grams has to less that 6 lbs. 


Will it be easier to reach speed because of decreased air density too?

Whole kit for 20ft balloon.

40ft double price but double the list. 
Burst Altitude: 120,000

How the hell do we know if we got it in orbit? What kind of radio?
