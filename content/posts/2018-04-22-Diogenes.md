So [Diogenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes) was [great](https://existentialcomics.com/comic/219).  Some qoutes. 

 - Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, "I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave."

 - When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body

 - On the indecency of his masturbating in public he would say, "If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly."

 - Someone took him [Diogenes] into a magnificent house and warned him not to spit, whereupon, having cleared his throat, he spat into the man's face, being unable, he said, to find a meaner receptacle.

 -  What I like to drink most is wine that belongs to others. 

-  Plato gave the tongue-in-cheek[26] definition of man as "featherless bipeds," Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, saying, "Behold! I've brought you a man,"


 - Plato: My good Diogenes, if you knew how to pay court to Dionysius, you wouldn’t have to wash vegetables.” “
   Diogentes: If you knew how to wash vegetables, you wouldn’t have to pay court to Dionysius.”

- Carried around a lamp at daytime claiming to be looking for an honest man.
