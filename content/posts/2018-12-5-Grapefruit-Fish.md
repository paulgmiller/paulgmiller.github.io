## Notes
Grapefruit extract added after fermentation?
Really stressing what hop cages in brewie can actually handle. 
yeast seemed dead so addead safale 02. Really short fermenation but hydrometer reading was low after a week so gave up. Thought I got some fusel alcohol but might be early. Nope was bad dumped it.
