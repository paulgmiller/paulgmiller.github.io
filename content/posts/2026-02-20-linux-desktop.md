First day after last day at msft I reimaged all my machines. Windows itself isn't bad (yeah ssh, powershell and wsl) but the junk our IT department installs definitely is.
So while I was Reimaging decided it was time for some linux desktop on my three machines. 

## Bee / Nuc mini computer + Omakub

So this has worked pretty good. Camera and audio fine. Had to fight blue tooth mouse disconnect but chapgpt seemed to figure it out. 
Chrome, VSCode, Spotify all seem fine.
Still using gnome terminal over alacrity some of the time. 
Omakub certaily has option s 


2) Omarchy on my pc part picker build (ryzen)
This has been fun. Tiling window manager! no overlap. Better at forcing you to organize things.
Browser tabs still get out of control though.
Have not dug into arch/pacman yet. 
But it does seem to go down when not in use over night so need to figure out that uptime



3) ubuntu 25 on lenovov snapdragon

Oof this is pretty painful. Writing this because it just hard rebooted twice and chatgpt and I couldn't find much in journalctl
Suspend doesn't really work and drains your battery over night. 
Dealing witht that by powersing off on laptop lid close but sucks to lose anything you didn't save
Audio and camera don't work.
Even not susprended battery doesn't seem quite as good. 

Still on queue. Bluefin/Fedora and ground up NixOS. Also do I take the neo vim pill
