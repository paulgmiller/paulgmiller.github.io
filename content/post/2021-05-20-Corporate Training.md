I kind of despis most corporate training. It's all the same and I don't think 90% of participants force to take it get anything out of it.


1. Ice breaker
1. everybody write something on a whiteboard.
1. Here's my arbitary grouping/labeling system apply it your self 
1. Share why you think you've put your self in this box
1. small group discsussion. Mabye some role playing
1. here's a group of values that you should strive towards even though several of them are in direct conflict

Maybe some very unreflective people go through them and decide they have been big jerks? I don't know.
