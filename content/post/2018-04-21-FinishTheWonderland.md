Apparently [reservations](https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit.htm) are already full so we just have to do day of.

## Trip Plan 1. (32 miles) (completionist)
- Day 1: Longmire to Maple crek
- Day 2: Maple Creek to Indian Bar 
- Day 3: Indian Bar to FryingPan Creek/Whiteriver (Lunch at summerland)

## Trip Plan 2 (25 miles)
- Day 1 : Reflection Lakes to Nikcel Creek
- Day 2 : Nickel Creek to Summerland (or indian bar)
- Day 3 : Summerland to White river.

## Trip Plan 3 (18 miles) (we are old)
- Day 1 : Box Canyon to Indian Bar. (maybe camp at maple creek the night before if we get in late)
- Day 2 : Indian bar to FryingPan Creek/White river.

### Thoughts
Trip plan 1 might be 4 days if we leave late on friday as opposed to early saturday. Plan 3 isn't competiost but requires no time off theoretically. Favor Late August/Early Sept but flexible.
