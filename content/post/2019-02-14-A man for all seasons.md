title: A man for all seasons
---
Pulled out my high school copy of a man for all season and went through the underlined passages (some had stars next to them whatver that means). This book had an outsidzed influence for it's stubborn humble yet righteous protatagonist, which he carries out despite seeming like an oxymoron. Starts english/common law/libertarian then becomes quite catholic. Qoutes are Sir Thomas Moore unless otherwised stated. 

* King Henry: There are those like Norfolk who follow me because I wear the Crown, and there are those like Master Cromewell who follow me because they are Jackals with sharp teeht and I am their lion, and there is a mass that follows me because it follows anything that moves--and there is you.
* this (tapping himself) is not the stuff martyrs are made of.
* Margaret: Father that man's bad. M: There is no law against that. Roper: There is! God's law!. M: Then God can arrest him. 
* The currents and eddies of right and wrong, which you find such plain sailing, I can't navigate...But in the thickets of the law, oh, there I'm a forester. I doubt if there's a man alive who could follow me there.
* Roper: You give the devil the benefit of the law. M: What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? Roper: I'd cut down every law in England to do that! M: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you--where would you hide, the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws rom coast to coast--man's lasws not God's--and if you cut them down--and you're just the man to do it--d'you think you could stand up right in the winds that would blow then? Yes I'd give the devil the benfit of the law for my own safety's sake. 
* God's my god.... but I find him rather too... subtle... I don't know where he is or what he wants.
* But at worst we could be beggars and still keep company and be merry togehter. 
* I insult no one I will not take the oath. I will not taell you why I will not. Norfolk: Then your reasons must be treasonable!. M: Not "must be", may be. Norfolk It's a fair assumption! M: the law requires more than an assumption the law requires a fact.
* And when we stand before God, and you are sent to Paradise for doing according to your conscience, and I am damned for not doing accoding to mine, will you come with me, for fellowship?
* When a man takes an oath, Meg, he's holding his own self in is own hands. Like water...And if he opens his fingers then--he needen't hope to find himself again.
* If we lived in a State where virtue was profitable, common sense would make us good, and gred would make us saintly. And we'd live like animals or angels in the happy land that needs no heroes.
* Well.. finally.. it isnt a matter of reason; finally it's a matter of love.
* For our deaths my lodr, your and mine, dare we for shame enter the Kingdom with ease, when Our Lord Himself entered with so much pain.
* The world must construe according to its wits. This court must construe according to the law.
* Can I help my King by giving him lies when he asks for truth? WIll you help England by populating her with liars? 
* In good faith Rich I am sorrier for your perjury than my peril.
