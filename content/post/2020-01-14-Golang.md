* Who decided null should be nil now? Other forced styling like egyptian braces are fine.
* Really long functions seem to be the norm. 
* Does not having exceptions play a role cause you need to check return so factoring out 4-5 lines is no longer worth it. 
* No semicolons is good I guess?
* Lordy do I miss Linq style functional stuff. Generics maybe coming in the future (though maybe not)
* returning strings as errors is actually okay??? returing nil for success seems strange
* Fuck you inheritance. I guess that's probably actually good.
* Ternary or null coalescing operators? Nah
