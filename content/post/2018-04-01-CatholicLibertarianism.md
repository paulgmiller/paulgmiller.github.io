*Expect this to be updated just an outline for now* 

- A man has to have a code. But few ever write it down. Free to choose. Xavarian Brothers . My parents
- What Catholicism get right. 
  - Other People are important. Altruism matter. 
  - All are welcome we are all people.  Even if you don't like other people.
- What Ayn Rand got wrong. 
- Hierarchy and Control vs Tradition. 
- Coercing other people is not virtue. Signal vs action. 
- Markets enable people. Free to choose. Growth. Outcomes matter. Children and the future matter. Work matters.
- Wealth is not the enemy but consumption is should be taxed.  Inheiretance tax.
- All part of gods plan vs The random sputtering of a pointless universe.
- Future things to talk on: Pascifism, Homosexuality, Women Clergy
