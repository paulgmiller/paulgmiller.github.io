Qoutes from the prose edda (icelandic norse mythology source) [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/notes/8134306-the-prose-edda/68459891-paul-miller?ref=rsp):

* On Fenrir's Bonds (loki's gigantic wolf son that eats odin at ragnarok):
"It was constructed from six elements: the noise of a cat’s footsteps, the beard of a woman, the roots of a mountain, the sinews of a bear, the breath of a fish, and the spittle of a bird. "

* On Hospitality: "Or is water drunk there?’ High replied, ‘That is a strange question. Would All-Father invite kings, jarls [earls] and other men of rank to his hall and give them water to drink? Truly, many who come to Valhalla, having suffered wounds and the pain of death, would think a drink of water dearly bought if no better greeting were available."

* On the Godess Hel : "Her hall is called Eljudnir [Sprayed with Snowstorms], her dish is Hunger, her knife is Famine, her slave is Lazy, and Slothful is her woman servant. The threshold over which people enter is a pitfall called Fallandaforad [Falling to Peril], her bed is named Kor [Sick Bed], and her bed curtains are named Blikjandabol [Gleaming Disaster]."
