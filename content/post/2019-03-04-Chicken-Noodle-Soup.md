title: Chicken Noodle Soup
---

From my mother:

### You will need 
* carrots 
* Celery,  
* egg noodles (medium width),
* bay leaves, 
* chicken breast 
* either chicken soup base or chicken bouillon.  You can also use canned chicken stock.  

### Directions
* Peal and chop up the 1 carrot and  1 stalk of celery. 
* Rinse chicken breast and trim off any fat.  
* Put about 3-4 cups of water in medium saucepan.  
* Add 2 chicken breasts, celery, carrots, 1 TBsp chicken base or 2-3 cubes of bouillon, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp of pepper.    I also add the leaves from the inside of the celery.  
* Bring to boil over medium heat and boil until chicken and carrots are done. NB
* Remove chicken, bay leaves and celery leaves.  
* Add about 2 handfuls of noodles to liquid.  
* Shred chicken and return to pot.  
* Cook until noodles are done.  About 10 minutes.  

If you use canned chicken stock you might want to cook the noodles separately since they absorb quite a bit of liquid.
