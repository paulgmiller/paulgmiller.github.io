title: Netlify and blog thoughts

So this is pretty neat: https://eloquent-shirley-d00b8c.netlify.com

They basically are just a git hook + agent with  bunch of differnt tools that produce and the host static websites. 
They handle caching and hosting. https://www.netlify.com/docs/

Neat because
* Give me another publisher option. 
* Allows testing/flighting with different branches.
* Could do random other things on publish 

Kind of want to generate workitems/burndown from a markdown file. 

Theoretically anything you could do here you could do in github, azure vsts but you have to hook the website publis together so this just fels easier.

Liking my blog though can't contribute drafts/from my phone easily. 
###  Update
