Code size.
##Proposition 
Value of a developer is features / (lines of code + number of dependenceis)
##
* Unittests can be bad if mocking balloons code size (also are you really testing 
* Dependencies on services are great.
* Config flags/flighting while normally great can baloon code size if not cleaned aggressively 
* Beware the you competent developer who goes and creates a whole new system from scratch
* microservices really need to have little boiler plate.
