## DIRECTIONS

Mash the grains at 152°F (70°C) for 60 minutes. If you are including a mash-out step, raise the temperature to 168°F (76°C) and hold for 10 minutes. Sparge with 168°F (76°C) water to collect 6.53 gallons (24.7 liters) of wort. Boil for 80 minutes, following the hops schedule. At flame-out, stir the wort to cool slightly and add the whirlpool hops. Let rest for 20 minutes before chilling the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature. Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 60–62°F (15–16°C).

Add the dry hops toward the end of active fermentation, when the SG is about 1.020–1.024. Let rest for 4 days or until fermentation is complete. Cold crash to drop the hops out of solution. Rack to secondary or keg.
