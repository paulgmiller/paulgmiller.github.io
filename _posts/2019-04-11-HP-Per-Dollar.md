I like cars but am a cheap S.O.B. so I find my self buid/pricing cars I'll never buy.
Here's a fun excerise with cars I might some day buy. Ignoring some engines < 2.0L

## Metodology
Goto ford vehicles.
Find the cheapest model for ech power train. But keep it 4x4 except the edge sts. Must have 4 doors. Numbers are actually hp per 1k dollars.
The f-150 ones are dumb because they way over optimize for torque (though so does the ranger) and I would not buy a truck that big. I won't buy a mustang till kids are driving themselves. 

## Results
* Ecosport SES = 166 / 26.870 = 6.17  (149 ft/lpbs)
* Escape Titanium = 245 / 31.715 = 7.72
* Edge ST = 335 / 41.450 = 8.0
* Ranger = 270 / 30.680  = 8.8
* Explorer ecoboost = 280 / 31.855 = 8.7
* Explorer sport = 365 / 45.220 = 8.07
* Toyota Tacoma = 278 / 32.195 = 8.6
* Toyota Rav4 hybrid 219 / 27.7 = 7.9
* F150 3.3 v6 = 290 / 35.54 = 8.16
* F150 2.7L ecoboost = 325 / 36.535 = 8.9
* F150 2.5L ecoboost = 375 / 38.135 = 9.8
* F150 v8 = 395 / 37.535 = 10
* mustang ecoboost = 310 / 26.49 = 11.7
* mustang v8 = 460 / 34.95 = 13.16
  
For ranger wins. Of course most of the other options come with way better options at that trim level but whatever. Next excerise would be to divide this by weight in which case the ecosport porbably wins. Also there is no replacement for displacement.
