Turns out march 2013 was a good time to read a [book about how GE was secretly a bank that failed](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Failure-Rise-Fall-American-ebook/dp/B09SL541PT/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1PZOQPGBFEFJW&keywords=power+failure&qid=1678858582&sprefix=gas+grill%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-1).

* Jack womanizer I guess I shouldnt be suprised
* Recap of the disaster
   * In the 90s GE used its AAA credit rating to grow a ginormous financial divison that accounted for 50% of its profits. Some parts wer related (airplane, power leasing). Some parts were not. (leveraged buyouts, real estate, insurance). It did not have backup lines of credit but used short term loans that could (and did) dry up. 
   * 2001 made people realize GE had huge liabilities because it insured both planes and the wtc. (I was familiar with this part)
   * 2007-8 GE capital did not divest from real estate (despite some internal advice to do so). It went down hard. It's short term financing went away and credit rating went down. It snuck into bailouts by the skin of its teeth by getting declared structurally important.
   * 2018 same time Jeff got ousted at CEO it got a double whammy. A small LTC insurance bussiness it failed to spinoff posted a 20 BILLION loss because its models sucked. The power bussiness crapped itself (part failed merger, part terrible forcast, par bad management)
   * GE is now basically a jet engine bussiness and a seperate power bussiness. 

* Though the book is ambivalent about wether Jeff or Jack set up GE to fail it leans more heavily to jeff. But not sure that's right. Jeff did try and unwind GE capital but kinda of failed to miss the most important parts (real estate and the LTC). It's not clear what Jack built was ever sustainable. Success has a thousand father and failure is an orphan. Jeff is that orphhan.
