I watched a bourbon documentary. Moslty is was crap but I enjoyed the guy from buffalo trace immensley. Especially the story about his dad. He was enjoying some rare bottle he found 

## Goto's
* 1792 (Ridgemont reserve)
* Woodford's 
* Maker's 46
* Jim Beam Black - amazing for its price point

## Wheated 
 Weller and Pappy van winkle are hard to find but here these are pretty close. Technically two of these aren't bourbons

* Larceny
* Wyoming Whiskey
* Bernheim wheat whiskey.

## Other good choices
* Old Forresters bottled in bond/1870 
* Bulleit - if you want a kick in the teeth
* Elijah Craig 


## Overrated.
* Bookers
* Blantons
