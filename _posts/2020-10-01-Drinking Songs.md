> I remember the night she sat down beside me
> She cried love was a ring that won't end, well I was handed a lie
> Now the only thing I know of a ring is the circle my glass leaves behind

> Looking at the world throught the bottom of a glass. 
> All I see is a man who's fading fast.

> There stands the glass
> That will ease all my pain
> That will settle my brain
> It's my first one today

[There stands the glass - Best of Webb Pierce](https://open.spotify.com/track/0VxX3RBKO46Ky6XgvN0bME)


> And the car in the lane next to me was driven by a little boy
> And he flashed a smile at me then he drove straight off the road
> Smacked an overpass, I watched his car explode
> And when she wakes me from my delirium
> I know I'm no longer fun
> For her

> Whiskey bottle over Jesus
> Not forever, just for now

[Whiskey Bottle - Uncle Tupelo]


> If I make it through this year, I think I'm gonna put this bottle down
> Maybe as time goes on I'll learn to miss it less than I do now

[Whiskey without women - Drive by truckers]

> And the beer I had for breakfast 
> wasn't bad so I had one more for desert

[Sunday Morning coming down - Johnny Cash
