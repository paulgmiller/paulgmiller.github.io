These are the sad ones. I'll get to the fun ones later..

> I remember the night she sat down beside me  
> She cried love was a ring that won't end, well I was handed a lie  
> Now the only thing I know of a ring is the circle my glass leaves behind

> And the car in the lane next to me was driven by a little boy  
> And he flashed a smile at me then he drove straight off the road

> For her
