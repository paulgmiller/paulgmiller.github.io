I am probably going to lost this bet because 2000 is pretty low but I wanted to bet against the corona virus hysteria. Especially since some people are claiming there will be megadeaths.

Here's me talkign to my friends on whats app. about this Robin Hanson odds: [ #COVID19 will kill >250K in US by 1/1/2022, as reported later by WHO? ](https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1236438140103069698?s=20)

2000 is far less than that. In  my favor it it's at 22 now and if it doubles every month we're looking at < < 1000 in August. We're also going into summer which isn't great for flu. Going against me is this trump administration might have no idea what they are doing. Luckily America is somewhat decentralized still.

Guess we could use [WHO numbers though](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/)
