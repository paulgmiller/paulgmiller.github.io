My boss' boss who I like and respect bandied about a popular claim that China would suprass US GDP by 2030. This sounded lazily familiar so I tried to challenge him to a bet in the elevator but he demurred 
Still open to giving some one 2:1 odds that China  will not surpass US GDP. Let me lay out an argument. 

## Reasons for china pesimism. 
* Population: a huge part of gdp is actually raw population. While the US has obviously not in a baby boom it at least allows some immigration offset. China's seems to be trying to rollback the the one child policy but is not having much success. Sometime in the 2030-40's chinas population should invert with more old to support than young to support them.
* Catch up growth / historical precedent: Remember the 80's Japan was going blow right past us? Go watch some 80's movies/sci fi. Zaibatsu were unstoppable.  Turned out Japan was doing alot of catch up growth
* Rising costs: turns out a prosperous people start valueing thnings like a better environment, leisure time 
* State sponsered entities.
* The great wall of china.
