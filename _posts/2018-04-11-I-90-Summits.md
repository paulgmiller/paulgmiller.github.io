Yeah, yeah I know seattle has a huge diversity of hiking areas but sometimes you need to crank one out and get back for your kids bath time. So hooray for I-90

- [Mt Si](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-si)
  Ah the classic. Lunch on the rocks. Maker sure you do the haystack.

- [Mt Teneriffe](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-teneriffe-road-trail)
  Actually a better view than sigh and pretty much same drive. Hike is a bit longer and lass woods is a bit chewed up. 
- [Rattlesnake ledge](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/rattle-snake-ledge)
  Take your grandparents it's fast. I really need to go up to [east peak](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/east-peak-rattlesnake-trail) or the 10 miles to [snoqualmie pt](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/rattle-snake-mountain).

- [Mailbox Peak](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mailbox-peak)
  New trail isn't the crazy mudcliff the old one was. More like si but 30% harder. 40% better views.

- [Mt Washington](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-washington-1)
  Almost secret entrance east of twin falls. Steep gravely trail. Cool tree hallways. Really wanted to cedar morse lake view but got fog.
- [Kendall Katwalk](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/kendall-katwalk)
  Love this hike. Start of of the PCT. Pretty long but once it gets pretty it just stays that way for miles. 
- [Bandera](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/bandera-mountain)
  Meadow scramble but more of a ridge than a summit. Still great flowers and rainer.

- [Mt Defiance](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-defiance).
  Secretly great. Left on bandera past mason lake and keep going. View from away from the highway.

- [Granite Mt.](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/granite-mountain-1)
  Been 8 years need to go back. Love the alpine meandos and I'm a sucker for a lookout

- [Mt. Catherine](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-catherine)
  Took a six month old up includin the 9 foot rock scramble with a chain at the top. Great view of rainer but also bugs a the top.
