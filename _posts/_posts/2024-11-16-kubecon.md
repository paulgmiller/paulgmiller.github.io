kubecon post thoughts. 

1. PodDisription Conidtions and Eviction Backpressure on replicasets-deployments and stateful sets.
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128815. The former should help https://github.com/paulgmiller/k8s-pdb-autoscaler along but the latter should make it not necessary

1. Antonio's/Network-Sig's [kube-network-policies](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-network-policies)  may be able to be trivailly adapted to windows with this [tailscale windows filter library](https://github.com/tailscale/wf). 
Theorically you could use ebpf to send packets into user space as well. 

1. Cilum Scaling. Several good presentations thoug many stared with cluster mesh. Not really a desire for us to got etcd but there are limitations 
    1. Growing our api server
    1. CBOR KEP may help some. 
    1. Maybe using apiserserv-mesh as a proxy.
    1. Ryan was excited about replacing watch with a messaging system
    1. Sig API maching thought streaming lists were going to help a lot. 

1. [Api server Server roll back is being worked on!](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4330) Need to catch up

1. Api Server backed by Postgresql was a little dissapoinig. Need to measure watch performnce and write a follow up
