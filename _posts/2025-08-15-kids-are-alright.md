The kids are alright.

Since I was "junior" engineer there have been a bunch of stuctual changes

* Facebook, Amazon and Google blew out the market for young engineers ESPECIALLY at top schools.
* There are more CS grads but if you think school is mostly about signaling that doesn't mean you get more smart kids.
* Seniors went remote in 2020 and most didn't come back. Mentoring over teams is much more transactional. 

Now AI is making all the hiring managers be like wait what am I paying for? And the best young kids can learn from Chatgpt and open source and just do founders. So maybe we'll see a collapse and then a shartage. Fun for everyone.
