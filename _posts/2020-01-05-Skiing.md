Today was Benji's first ski lesson. He did great. Between lessons, rentals, two season passes it was a pretty expensive 2 hours of leisure. 
I have (or will have) other posts on the value of cheapness, and I'm pretty frugal with my other hobbies. So let me rationalize why I care about Skiing.

* Outdoors are special. You will see [views](2018-11-18-Panoramas.md) that will change you won't see otherwise.
* Seattle winters can be brutal. Snow is better than rain and you can maximimze the few hours of sunlight you get. 
* Skiing get exponentially more fun the better you get. Square miles open up and you can cover more territory in a day then you could in a month hiking. Going from groomers to trees is special type of magic.
* Pretty decent workout.
* Forced conversation with friends on the ski lift.
* If you really do it right you end up in a hot tub with freinds and beers at a cabin with no phones.
