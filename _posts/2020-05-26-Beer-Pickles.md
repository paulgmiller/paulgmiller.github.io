Throw everythign but the cucumber and dill into pan. Simmer at boil for 3 minutes. Cool. Dump in air tight container filled with cucumbers and dill. Leave 24 hours in fridge.


*Update 2025*
These [habenero pickles](https://chatgpt.com/share/67942e6f-5730-8009-a2c7-4d55cbef8b14) were very popular. 
* 1 cup beer (light or medium-bodied)
* 1 cup distilled white vinegar
* 1 tbsp sugar (optional, balances the beerâ€™s bitterness)
*1 tbsp salt (non-iodized)

heat till disolved by not boiling?
* 10-12 small cucumbers (preferably pickling cucumbers or Persian cucumbers, 3-4 inches long)
* 3-4 fresh habanero peppers, left whole or sliced for more spice infusion
* 2 cloves garlic, whole
* 1/2 tsp black peppercorns
* 1/2 tsp mustard seeds
* 1/2 tsp dill seeds
 
I didn't have mustard seeds or dill seeds so I did corriander, dill weed and celery salt (proportions unknown)
