Trying to make a kickstarter for this laughable project but some numbers. 

 max take off weitght=439985kg
Crusing speed = 920 km/h 

27359 km/h Orbital velocity
20kg payload.

(439985*920- 27359*20)/439965  = 918.79
you'd only lose like 2km/h on the plane

Air pressure is 14% of sealevel at 747 cruising altitude

From brad:
Looks like 70000kg of capacitors will get you 10.4M Wh of energy storage
I'm getting 563M Joules to accelerate 20kg to orbital velocity  = 156K watt hours
And we have 10.4M Wh to work with

76.25meters of runway if you go tail ot nosecone.
