common/utils/helper packages/libs are bad and you should feel bad adding to them.

But.... sharing is good who could be against those things! DRY!

Sharing is good but couopling is bad. create tiny shared packages with a specific purpose you can infer from thr name. in golang mkdir is cheap!

Utils packages are the laziest form of sharing. the intrefaces are usually not thought through. unrealted things are stuck together often with no owner. 
invariably it will continue to grow. Lazy developers will plop more things into this tragedy of the commons.

In a larger code base you want your depenedency tree wide and flat but these packages create a gordian knot where any change to them rebuilds everything.
