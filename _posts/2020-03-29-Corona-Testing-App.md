So  [my bet](/2020/03/09/Morbid-Corona-Bet.html) with elliot went south quickly and I already paid him a couple of days before we hit 20k Us deaths.

I am still optimistic though that
1. lockdowns and social distancing will have a big effect
2. sadly the very old sick are the main victms
and that we'll see exponential growth level off.

Figuring out a strategy for trying to return post lockdown but pre-vaccine is important, so here's a modest proposal 

* Prereq: quarantine ends and testing becomes much cheaper/faster available&
* When you get tested you associate it with guid/public key on your phone presumably in an app
* Testers publish guid, result and date of test to a database/block chain
* Now you want to get a hair cut or go-to a bar
*  You have to tap your phone against another phone on the entryway (nfc presumably)
*  If your phone's guid is tested clear in n days you get a happy green
*  If m's day then maybe a warning orange buzz to remind you
*  no test or past m days red alarm and social pressure or a bouncer makes you leave

N, M are configurable based on the establisments risk factor. A sporting event might require testing in last 2 days.  Also maybe testing for antibodies gets you a higher n, m.

One of the goals here is to avoid facial or cell tracking and the draconian privacy envasion that entails.
