If you're a true utilitarean (which I am not) confronted with the [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) you hopefully have your actuarial tables memorized and are a pretty good judge of age. Who dies matters as much as how many. 

[Actuarial Tables](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html) And 
[CDC death by age data](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku/data)

Data as of 5/20 starting 2/1 we have *851220* years of life lost

[Excel](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AmnYrFj4NbdXk-8lkiAHvux3me6nhA?e=0MfQqU)

For Vietnam I'm not super happy with these data sources but obviously deaths were more concentrated in young males. [vhfcn.org](http://www.vhfcn.org/stat.html) or [militaryfactory.com?](https://www.militaryfactory.com/vietnam/casualties.asp)

58,148 KIA at a median age of 23.11 years.

[1970 actuarial tables](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_7_1970.html) show 54.78 life expectancy.

54.78*58148 = *3185347.44*

So by this measure we're not a vietnam level tragedy yet but we are about 25% there after only 3 months where vietnam unrolled over several years so we'll see.  Also remains to be seen what the damage is for those that survived.
