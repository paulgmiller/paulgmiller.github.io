common/utils/helper paxkages/libs are bad and you should feel bad adding to them.

but sharing is good who could be against those things! DRY!

sharong is good but couopling is bad. create tiny shared packages with a specific purpose you can infer from thr name. in golang mkdir os cheap!

utils packages are the laziest form of sharing. the intrefaces are usually not though through. unrealted things are stuck together often with no owner. 
invariably it will continue to grouw lazy developers will plop more things into this tragedy of the commons.

im a larger code base you want your depenedcy treer wide and flat but three packages create a gordian knot.
